# Encryption-Decryption-Tool
A C++ console-based Cipher System (Encryption-Decryption-Tool) demonstrating classic cryptographic algorithms including Caesar, Substitution, Playfair, Hill, and Vigenère ciphers. Developed using functional programming concepts with dynamic user interaction.

# 🔐 C++ CIPHER SYSTEM

A console-based encryption and decryption system implemented in **C++** using **functional programming concepts**. This project demonstrates classic cryptographic algorithms such as:

- Caesar Cipher  
- Substitution Cipher  
- Playfair Cipher  
- Hill Cipher  
- Vigenère Cipher  

Each algorithm is interactively selectable and provides both encryption and decryption functionality.
